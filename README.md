## 8D

Using the first 4 mono tracks, it will convert it to 8-track with left and right channels sepparated.

Each original track will be on a different "location", when listening in stereo mode (ear/headphones recommended):

* 1st track: far left (southwest)
* 2nd track: near left (northwest)
* 3rd track: near right (northeast)
* 4th track: far right (southeast)


This macro will still allow listening in mono or even with a single channel, without any issue
